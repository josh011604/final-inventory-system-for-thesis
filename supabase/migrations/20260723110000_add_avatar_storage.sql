-- Profile picture uploads: a public "avatars" bucket where each user may only
-- write inside their own uid-prefixed folder (avatars/{auth.uid()}/...), enforced
-- via storage.objects RLS. Read is public so avatars render for any viewer
-- (header, Users table) without needing a signed URL. profile_picture_url on
-- public.profiles already exists (see 20260708_0001_school_inventory.sql) and is
-- writable by the owning user under the existing "profiles update own or admin"
-- policy, so only the bucket + object policies are needed here.
